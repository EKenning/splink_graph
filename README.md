`splink_graph` is a small graph utility library in the Apache Spark environment, that works with graph data structures based on the `graphframe` package,
such as the ones created from the outputs of data linking processes (candicate pair results) of ![splink](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink])  





The main aim of `splink_graph` is to offer a small set of functions that work on top of established graph packages like `graphframes` and `networkx`  , that help with
the process of data linkage
