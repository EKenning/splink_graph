# splink_graph

splink_graph is a small graph utility library in the Pyspark environment that works with graph data structures 
created from the outputs of data linking processes (candicate pair results) of ![splink](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink])

The aim of splink_graph is to offer a small set of functions that work on top of graph packages like graphframes and networkx and that help with
the process of data linkage
